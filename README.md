// WELCOME TO NOON //

Noon is a React-based weather app that provides users with both current weather conditions and a 7-day forecast. With a sleek and intuitive interface, Noon allows users to quickly access information about temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and more. In addition to real-time updates on the current weather, Noon also provides users with the weather forecast for the same time every day for the next 7 days. This feature makes it easy for users to plan their week ahead, whether it's for work, travel, or leisure activities. With Noon, you can stay informed about the weather conditions in your specified locations and stay up to date!

This App features an accordion menu, a convenient way to display the forecast for the next 7 days. This type of menu allows users to easily navigate between days by expanding and collapsing individual panels for each day. Each panel typically displays the day of the week and a brief summary of the weather conditions for that day, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. Users can click on a panel to expand it and view more detailed information about the weather forecast for that day.

The Celsius to Fahrenheit button is a user-friendly feature that allows users to switch between temperature units on a weather app or website. By clicking on the button, users can choose to see the temperature displayed either in Celsius or Fahrenheit, depending on their preference. This button is especially useful for users who are more familiar with one temperature scale over the other, or who need to convert the temperature to a different unit for a specific purpose.
