// WELCOME TO NOON //

Noon is a React-based weather app that provides users with both current weather conditions and a 7-day forecast. With a sleek and intuitive interface, Noon allows users to quickly access information about temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and more. In addition to real-time updates on the current weather, Noon also provides users with the weather forecast for the same time every day for the next 7 days. This feature makes it easy for users to plan their week ahead, whether it's for work, travel, or leisure activities. With Noon, you can stay informed about the weather conditions in your specified locations and stay up to date!

This file is available as publically hosted domain @https://joshp2401.github.io/Project-NOON/ and can also be run by opening your terminal -> running npm start.

This App features an accordion menu, a convenient way to display the forecast for the next 7 days. This type of menu allows users to easily navigate between days by expanding and collapsing individual panels for each day. Each panel typically displays the day of the week and a brief summary of the weather conditions for that day, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. Users can click on a panel to expand it and view more detailed information about the weather forecast for that day.

The Celsius to Fahrenheit button is a user-friendly feature that allows users to switch between temperature units on a weather app or website. By clicking on the button, users can choose to see the temperature displayed either in Celsius or Fahrenheit, depending on their preference. This button is especially useful for users who are more familiar with one temperature scale over the other, or who need to convert the temperature to a different unit for a specific purpose.

------- EASTER EGGS --------

There are a few hidden surprises for those to find. The hints are as follows:

1. The pressure on the sixth day of the weak? Practically mercury.
2. Heritage Park is the new silicone valley.
3. Anywhere in Switzerland seems to come with it's perks.
4. Alphaville is really not even a scientific construct.
5. San Sebasti√°n has really great waves this time of year.
6. Flatanger has some challenging climbs! (this iconic duo can handle them)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
